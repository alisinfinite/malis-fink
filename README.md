# Malis for Mastodon
Horrible unreadable pastel theme for Mastodon made to match [Alis's blog](https://alis.me).

Mostly working, though might still have a few unthemed bits.

## Installation

0. Set your Mastodon theme to light mode.

1. Copy [stylus.css](https://github.com/alisinfinite/malis-fink/blob/main/stylus.css) into an extension like [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).

2. Change `@-moz-document domain("fandom.ink")` to `@-moz-document domain("your.mastodon.server")`.

3. "Enjoy".

## FAQ

### How do I make this less (or more) horrible?

Change the `--variables` to colors more (or less) pleasing to your eyes.

### Does this work with the multi-column layout?

I do not know because I do not use that mode.

### Can I use this (or a version thereof) as the main theme on my Masto server?

Sure, if you want to torture your users, go ahead (though see above).
